"""
Room sharing: who could share, and who may (SOW section 3, addendum B7 / C2).

Two rules, deliberately separate.

**Who could share** is a calendar question. Someone is a candidate if they hold a
live hotel traveller row - `ACTIVE_TRAVELLER_STATUSES` on a request that is
neither a draft nor cancelled - in the same city, on at least one of the same
nights. Pending counts as well as booked: the point of the prompt is to catch the
pairing before two rooms are reserved, and by the time both are BOOKED the saving
has already been missed.

**Who may share** is a policy question, and the policy is narrow. A shared room
is offered only on an **exact** `Gender` match between two people who have stated
a binary value. `OTHER` and `UNDISCLOSED` never share - not because the pairing
would be wrong, but because this system has not asked them, and a room is not
something to infer consent for. They are offered a separate room, silently; the
requester is never told a candidate was filtered out on gender grounds.

Open question **C2** is answered here by assumption, pending the client:

* the prompt shows the colleague's **name and designation** - this is an internal
  ops tool, and "1 colleague available" is not enough to make a decision on;
* the requester's choice is a *request*. `SHARE_EXISTING` sets
  `room_sharing` but leaves `share_confirmed_at` null until an **admin**
  confirms it in Phase 4;
* the colleague is **notified** when someone asks to share with them.

The colleague's own consent is not required. If the client wants it, the shape to
change is `confirm_share` plus one more column on `request_travellers` - the
matching and the disclosure rules above do not move.
