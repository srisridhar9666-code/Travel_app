"""
Admin decisions on individual travellers (SOW section 4).

The decision unit is one person on one request, never the request as a whole -
that is addendum B1, and it is what "selective approval" means in practice. A
group of four can come out of this queue as two approved, one rejected and one
still pending, and the request-level status is derived from that rather than set.

Three rules are enforced here rather than in the router, because every entry
point has to obey them identically:

* **Transitions are checked, not assumed.** `ALLOWED_TRAVELLER_TRANSITIONS` is the
  only definition of what may follow what. A decision is not undoable in V1;
  correcting one goes through cancel-and-reraise, exactly like an edit after the
  lock.
* **A rejection needs a reason, and so does approving over a conflict.** The
  second is addendum B6's other half: conflicts warn the requester, but an admin
  who approves anyway has to say why, and that reason lands in the ledger as
  `OVERRIDE_CONFLICT` *before* the approval it justifies.
* **Every decision notifies the traveller.** In app and, from Phase 5, by email -
  through the notification ledger, so "was this person told?" has an answer
  months later. Their manager is copied on the email and gets an in-app copy,
  because the decision is the second of two levels and the manager gave the
  first (`services/recommendations.py`).
