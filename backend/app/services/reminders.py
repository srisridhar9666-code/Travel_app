"""
Scheduled nudges, and the rules that stop them becoming noise.

Three jobs, all of them idempotent. Every notice they write carries a
`dedupe_key` naming the *event* rather than the run, so the same trip cannot be
reminded about twice however often the scheduler fires or however many workers
are running. The database holds that guarantee, not this code.

The hard part of a reminder system is not sending; it is not sending. A team
that receives a duplicate nudge twice learns to ignore all of them, and a
reminder nobody reads is worse than none because it still costs the sender's
reputation. So each job below is narrow on purpose, and each one says in its
docstring what it deliberately does not cover.
