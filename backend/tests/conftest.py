"""
Shared test setup.

Two things are enforced globally here.

**No test may send real email.** Delivery goes through a module-level transport,
and `.env` on a developer machine has real Gmail credentials in it, so a test
that happened to use an allowlisted address would actually post to someone's
inbox. The outbox is installed for the whole session rather than trusted to each
test remembering.

**Tests run against MySQL, not SQLite.** They used to use an in-memory SQLite
database, which was fast and wrong: the worst defect this project has had was
MySQL's `DATETIME` silently truncating the microseconds the audit hash chain
commits to, and no amount of SQLite testing could have found it. The engines
differ in exactly the places that matter here - fractional seconds, JSON
columns, string collation, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` - so the tests use the engine
the product actually runs on.

The cost is that a MySQL server must be reachable. The schema is built once per
session and each test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back afterwards,
so the suite stays quick despite the round trips.
